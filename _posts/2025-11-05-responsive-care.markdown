In New York City, where more than 200 languages are spoken, every interaction between a caregiver and an older adult is shaped not only by medical needs but by language, culture, and understanding. Language barriers are not minor inconveniences. They can deepen isolation, increase stress, and lead to errors in care. A [2023 Journal report](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10625452/) found that non-English-speaking caregivers experienced 40% higher stress levels due to communication difficulties. This isn’t just about words, it’s about emotional exhaustion, misinterpretation of needs, and, at times, unsafe care environments.

Research from the [Journal of Cross-Cultural Gerontology](https://www.researchprotocols.org/2022/7/e31691/) in 2022 found that when caregivers and older adults share the same language and cultural roots, care feels personal. Patients report higher satisfaction, better adherence to care, and lower hospitalization rates. Cultural competence is not a luxury,  it’s a determinant of health.

Our platform connects families with caregivers who speak their language and understand their traditions. This approach is more than convenience, it’s a redefinition of care itself. We acknowledge that healing begins with being understood.
