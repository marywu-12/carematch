Caregivers play a vital role in supporting the health and well being of older adults. Yet many caregivers face an invisible challenge: social isolation. [Studies](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11403199/) consistently show that disconnection from community increases the risk of depression, chronic illness, and premature mortality. For caregivers who often [shoulder the daily responsibility](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2791523/) of supporting loved ones, the experience of isolation, compounded with the stress of caregiving, can be both profound and invisible to others. 

Caregiver isolation manifests in many ways. Some describe the constant demands on their personal time, a [struggle](https://nafc.org/bhealth-blog/the-biggest-challenges-faced-by-caregivers/) that fails to leave space for friendships or personal pursuits. Others feel emotionally drained, with little energy left to engage further with their loved ones after a day of caregiving. According to Marvell Adams, CEO of the [Caregiver Action Network (CAN)](https://www.caregiveraction.org/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=7986097862&gbraid=0AAAAAD8MRVrKKEzj9tWAfSDNIFicuL9IG&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3aLHBhDTARIsAIRij59dHulKi2uX93IQKxP5Bvo4U_QB0fpLbjVxusIBaIEH3J3ZfvSiilIaAkW3EALw_wcB), caregiver isolation is a “quiet crisis”, and that caregivers can be so focused on someone else’s needs that their own well-being fades into the background.

It is important to let caregivers’ experiences take center stage, especially with the growing number of older adults and consequently, the growing number of caregivers. Introducing easier access to help in caring for older adults can significantly reduce the burden that contributes to caregiver isolation. When caregivers have reliable support networks or accessible assistance, they are better able to take time for self-care, social ties, and sustaining their mental health. When caregivers are better supported, it’s not just about easing their burden, it’s about honoring their humanity.
